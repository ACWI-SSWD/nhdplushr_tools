# NHDPlus HR VAA Navigator

The NHDPlusHR VAA Navigator performs navigation on the NHDPlusHR surface water network using NHDPlusHR Value Added Attributes found in the NHDPlusFlowlineVAA table.  The Navigator may be used through ArcMap via a special ArcMap toolbar or it may be called from user-written program code.  The Navigator will work on any NHDPlusHR gdb.  The gdb may contain a single Vector Processing Unit (VPU) or several VPUs that have been appended together.

The Navigator performs four types of navigation: upstream mainstem, upstream with tributaries, downstream mainstem, and downstream with divergences.   Navigations can begin and end on full NHDFlowline features or may begin and end as points along features.

Any of the four types of navigation may be stopped based on a user-supplied distance from the starting point.  Navigation results may also be filtered based on certain user specified criteria.

## Smart Snapper Programming Specification
SmartSnapper is a utility for migrating point and line events from one version of NHD (source) to another version of NHD (target).  The migration can go forward or backward in “NHD” time.  The two versions of NHD need not be the same resolution, however, migrating from a high resolution to a low resolution will not be as accurate.
